        <h1>Cyclone Gabrielle</h1>
        <p>Severe Tropical Cyclone Gabrielle was a tropical cyclone that affected New Zealand and Norfolk Island in February 2023. The fifth named storm of the 2022–23 Australian region cyclone season, and first severe tropical cyclone of the 2022–23 South Pacific cyclone season, Gabrielle was first noted as a developing tropical low on 6 February, while it was located to the south of the Solomon Islands, before it was classified as a tropical cyclone and named Gabrielle by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. The system reached a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone, before moving into the South Pacific basin, then rapidly degenerated into a subtropical low during 11 February.
         
        <p> Norfolk Island was placed under a red alert as Gabrielle approached, while heavy rain and wind warnings were issued across the North Island of New Zealand. States of emergency which were already in place in Auckland and the Coromandel as a result of the 2023 North Island floods were extended, and new states of emergency were declared in other areas. New Zealand began feeling the effects of the cyclone on 12 February with them still ongoing, with a national state of emergency being declared in the country on 14 February.</p>

        <h2>Meteorological History</h2>
         <p>During 6 February, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) reported that Tropical Low 14U had developed within a monsoonal trough of low pressure over the northeastern Coral Sea near the Solomon Islands.[1][2] At this stage, the system was located within a favourable environment for further development with low vertical wind shear of 10–30 km/h (5–15 mph) and warm sea surface temperatures of 29–30 °C (84–86 °F).[1][3] Over the next couple of days, the system gradually developed further as it moved south-westwards along a ridge of high pressure towards Queensland, Australia, before the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center initiated advisories and classified it as Tropical Cyclone 12P during 8 February.[4][5] At around the same time, the BoM reported that the tropical low had developed into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and named it Gabrielle.[5][6]</p>
         <p> Gabrielle slowly drifted southwards while deep convection consolidated,[7] and the cyclone was upgraded into a Category 2 tropical cyclone, while the JTWC upgraded Gabrielle to the equivalent of a low-end Category 1-equivalent cyclone with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph).[8] By 18:00 UTC on 9 February, the storm continued to intensify and soon became a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone.[9] Later the next day, the cyclone subsequently crossed 160°E, where it moved out of the Australian region and into the South Pacific basin where it became a Category 2-equivalent cyclone.[10][11] Gabrielle began to experience an increase in northwesterly vertical wind shear, the JTWC downgraded it to a Category 1-equivalent cyclone.[12] On 10 February, Gabrielle moved into MetService's area of responsibility.[13] The JTWC also discontinued warnings on the system around 21:00 UTC that day[14] Gabrielle was downgraded to a Category 2 tropical cyclone by the MetService.[15] During 11 February, after Gabrielle had passed directly over Norfolk Island, the BoM and MetService reported that Gabrielle had transitoned into a deep subtropical low.[16][17]</p>

                <li>On Norfolk Island, a red alert warning was issued before the Cyclone. During 11 February, Gabrielle passed directly over Norfolk Island.[34][35] Although the cyclone brought down trees and disrupted power, there were no reports of significant damage. Norfolk Island's emergency controller George Plant said there had been 40 calls for help, but the damage was "manageable."[36][37]</li>

            <li><em>New Zealand</em></li>
            <ul>
                <li>MetService reported that the cyclone brought gale-force winds to the North Island.[38] During 12 February, areas of the upper North Island began experiencing widespread power outages and property damage as the outer edges of the cyclone impacted the country,[25] with over 225,000 homes losing power across the North Island as the cyclone worsened through 13 and 14 February.[39] Transpower declared a grid emergency on 14 February after Hawke's Bay and Gisborne lost phone coverage, internet coverage, and electricity.[40] Severe flooding occurred as the cyclone impacted the country,[41] while some buildings had their roofs torn off in the wind or were damaged by landslides.[29][41] Multiple roads across the North Island were closed as a result of flooding and high winds, including Auckland Harbour Bridge.[21] Hundreds of people across the North Island were mandatorily evacuated, while hundreds more self-evacuated.[41] Two people went missing at sea near Great Barrier Island and Northland, who were both later found.[42] A firefighter went missing after being caught in a landslide in Muriwai, and was later found dead.[43] Three other people were found dead in Hawke's Bay, while one person was found dead in Gisborne.[44][45] Chris Hipkins announced on 13 February that the Government would provide NZ$11.5 million to support the community response to the cyclone.[22] The maximum rainfall from Gabrielle was 408.7 millimetres (16.09 in), which occurred at Glenbervie Forest.[46]</li>
                <br></br>
                    <li>In addition to the states of emergency in place in Auckland, Northland, and Thames-Coromandel, additional regional states of emergency were declared in Gisborne, the Bay of Plenty, and Waikato on 13 February, with local states of emergency being declared in the Waikato, Hauraki, Whakatāne, and Ōpōtiki Districts.[22] A regional state of emergency was declared in Hawke's Bay on 14 February, with local states of emergency being declared in the Napier, Hastings, and Tararua Districts,[41] before a national state of emergency was declared for only the third time in New Zealand's history later in the day.[47] Sittings of the House of Representatives were adjourned for a week.[48]</li>
                    <br></br>
                <li>In Hawke's Bay, power, phone service and internet access was cut to over 16,000 properties when the main Redclyffe substation was damaged after the Tūtaekurī River burst its banks.[49] Downstream, 1,000 people were evacuated from low lying plains surrounding the river, where significant parts of Taradale, Meeanee, and Awatoto were submerged.[49] Floodwaters destroyed 4 bridges, including Redcliffe Bridge, a major crossing just south of Taradale.[50] The Ngaruroro River burst its banks, flooding the town of Omahu where 20 people required evacuation via helicopter.[50] In Wairoa, the Wairoa River burst its banks, flooding approximately 15 percent of the town.[49] Access to Wairoa was cut off after extensive damage on SH2's Mohaka River Bridge in the south, and landslides to the north.[49] Water supply in Central Hawke's Bay failed, and a mandatory evacuation was ordered for eastern Waipawa after the Waipawa River rose to record levels.[49][50]</li>

                <li>In Vanuatu, Malpoi, a village in the northwest of Espiritu Santo, was severely affected with landslides, mud, and destruction of houses and gardens.[51] The water supply was also contaminated. As their plantations were damaged by the landslide, Allan Taman's chairman stated that the villagers may require long-term financial assistance.[51] In New Caledonia, strong swell warnings were put in place for 16 districts; 14 boats were damaged and one sunk due to wind and swells, leading to an evacuation plan for the damaged ships.[51]</li>
