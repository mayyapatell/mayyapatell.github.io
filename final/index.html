    <div class="main">
        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has forced schools and universities to shift to online learning, significantly
            impacting the education system. The future of education in the digital age has been the subject of much
            debate, with some advocating for a continuation of online learning, while others emphasize the importance of
            traditional classroom-based learning.
        </p>

        <p>While there are positives, online learning also has some drawbacks. One of the most significant is the lack
            of face-to-face interaction with teachers and peers. This can lead to feelings of isolation and
            disconnection from the learning community, impacting student engagement and motivation. Online learning
            requires strong self-discipline and motivation, which not all students possess.
        </p>
        <p> Due to the pandemic, the use of technology for school purposes has increased significantly. In the past,
            classrooms were primarily paper-based and teachers relied on chalkboards or whiteboards to convey
            information. Today, technology has transformed how students learn, with laptops, tablets, and smartphones
            becoming ubiquitous in the classroom.
        </p>

            <p>The following student behaviors were most frequently reported as having increased during the 2021–22
                school year (compared to a typical school year before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic) in part due to
                the COVID-19 pandemic and its lingering effects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Classroom disruptions from student misconduct (56 percent)</li>
                <li>Acts of disrespect towards teachers and staff (48 percent) </li>
                <li>Rowdiness outside of the classroom (49 percent) </li>
                <li>The prohibited use of electronic devices (42 percent)
                </li>

    <p>With the increased use of technology, many new challenges have arisen. For example, students may be more easily
        distracted by social media or other online activities during class, which can impact their ability to
        concentrate on learning. The use of technology can sometimes lead to a lack of critical thinking and creativity,
        as students may rely too heavily on technology to provide them with answers.</p>

    <p>The impact of technology on student engagement is a subject of much debate. Some argue that technology has made
        learning more engaging and interactive, while others argue that it has had the opposite effect. In some cases,
        technology has been shown to improve engagement by providing students with more personalized learning
        experiences and access to a wider range of resources. </p>

    <p>According to Barney McCoy, a researcher studying phone use in students for the Journal of Media Education, “a new
        study found that college students also spend more class time than ever using their smartphones and other
        devices. In fact, the study found that students check their phones and other devices more than 11 times a day on
        average.”</p>

    <p>The role of teachers in the new digital classroom is also changing- while teachers have always been an essential
        part of the learning process, their role is evolving to meet the needs of the digital age. Teachers must be able
        to adapt to new technologies and incorporate them into their teaching methods effectively. They must also be
        able to provide guidance and support to students who are learning online, often from remote locations. Because
        of their need to adapt, teachers have also been trying to offer more learning options for students: either
        face-to-face or online.</p>

    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of technology in education, and this trend is likely to
        continue in the future. Technology can be a powerful tool in enhancing student engagement and personalized
        learning experiences, but it requires careful implementation and monitoring to ensure it is used effectively. It
        is clear that technology will play an increasingly important role in education, and it is essential that we
        explore its potential while being mindful of its constraints.
