    <h1>THE TEACH ME HOW TO LOVE THIS WORLD; KEI ITO EXHIBIT AT THE STAMP GALLERY CLOSES ON DEC. 10.</h1>
    <h2>Published By: Stories Beneath the Shell</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Kei Ito, a Baltimore-based artist, shared four pieces of his artwork with the Stamp Gallery for the fall 2022
        semester. The exhibit opened on Oct. 18 and closed on Dec. 10.</p>
    <p>Kei Ito’s work is rooted in trauma and aims to explain the meaning of peace, war and how people come together
        during hardships. He uses different multimedia elements throughout his exhibition, to show the variety of
        experiences people can have.</p>
    <p>“This work was chosen for its relevance to contemporary issues that concern the UMD student population and
        connection to a variety of classes here at UMD,” said Tara Youngborg, the Stamp Gallery’s manager.</p>
    <p>Ito is a third-generation atomic bomb victim, called a hibakusha, and uses this trauma as inspiration for his
        work. Ito’s grandfather survived the U.S.’s atomic bombing of Hiroshima, and Ito reflects on this throughout the
        exhibition.</p>
    <p>He used cameraless photography, where objects are placed on light-sensitive paper to display an image, which is
        done entirely without the use of a camera or lens. He also used installation art, a type of artwork that uses a
        large amount of gallery space and allows viewers to be a part of the art.</p>
    <p>The first art piece displayed a pen and a bullet. The pen was used by his grandfather, who wrote books and
        stories about his experience in Hiroshima. After passing away from cancer in 2000, the pen remained untouched on
        his table for 20 years.</p>
    <p>“I found it recently, undiscovered since his passing 22 years ago,” Ito said.</p>
    <p>The bullet next to it was from WWII and is filled with Ito’s hair. It symbolizes his DNA and heritage through the
        actions of violence, said Ito. The bullet also signifies how the war led to his birth, he said.</p>
    <p>The two objects were placed on top of photographic prints that the artists developed.</p>
    <p>Another featured piece was a display of two projectors: one showing a pronoun and the other showing a noun. The
        noun is related to war, conflict, and trauma; and the pronoun is meant to show ownership, demonstrating an
        interconnectedness of people who experienced traumas and how their experiences become a part of them. The two
        projectors switched words every five seconds.</p>

    <p>“I think the art is impactful because it’s emphasizing the importance of generational trauma,” said Tyler
        Eckenrode, a visitor to the exhibit.“Ito didn’t experience the bombings firsthand, but through his art, he shows
        how the families of the victims carry the trauma. It also raises a lot of questions about morality, war, and
        what peace really means and shows it can be achieved.”</p>
