    <h1>THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND- HOME OF THE TERRAPINS, AND MAYBE GHOSTS </h1>
    <h2>Published By: Stories Beneath the Shell</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Our campus is filled with great opportunities, learning experiences, and a sense of community. However, the
        haunting stories spread throughout the years suggest that this campus is more than what it seems. From lecture
        halls to chapter houses, it seems like everywhere you go has a haunting tale.</p>
    <p>The University of Maryland has had many unexplainable events. An entire tour was created for those interested in
        exploring the places where there is said to be “paranormal activity.” The tour can be taken online through a
        map, where spooky tales about each stop are given.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Rossborough Inn</h3>
    <p>The Rossborough Inn is first on the tour and has the spookiest story of them all. The Inn was built in 1812,
        making it the oldest building on campus. Originally built to be a college, the Inn was sold and turned into a
        place to stay. Because of its excellent location, the Inn had many visitors and became a spot of uncanny events,
        according to the online tour.</p>
    <p>During the Civil War era, the Inn was managed by their most famous ghost: Miss Bettie. Visitors have claimed to
        see her wandering around the Inn wearing a long yellow gown.</p>
    <p>The Inn has also had other unexplainable occurrences. This includes flowers appearing out of nowhere, lights
        turning on and off, and doors mysteriously opening. There have also been sightings of a face appearing in
        mirrors and windows.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Marie Mount Hall</h3>
    <p>As we continue through the tour, Marie Mount Hall is next. Named after the former dean of the College of Home
        Economics, Marie Mount came to campus in 1919 and stayed until her death in 1957.</p>
    <p>During her time at the University of Maryland, it is rumored that she stayed in the building, specifically in a
        room known as the dean’s apartment.</p>
    <p>When visiting this building, the atmosphere itself was eerie, according to the online tour. Students and visitors
        have reported they sense a presence, and say strange things happen. Allegedly, doors open and shut by themselves
        and toilets flush on their own. It has also been said that on stormy nights, someone playing the piano can be
        heard and it is assumed to be the ghost of Mount.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Dormitory Halls and Dining Hall</h3>
    <p>Next on the tour are the dormitory halls and the dining hall, which have had plenty of reported instances of
        paranormal activity, according to the tour.</p>
    <p>In Washington Hall, basketball player Len Bias overdosed on cocaine and died. The tour noted that since the day
        he passed in 1986, people have reported weird occurrences.</p>
    <p>“People have said they heard basketball dribbles at night,” said Jeffery Tsao, a previous resident of Washington
        Hall.</p>
    <p>Morrill Hall is known as one of the spookiest buildings on campus, according to the tour. It is home to many
        ghostly legends, where events have been reported since the 1860s. South Campus Dining Hall and LeFrak Hall were
        built on Morrill Hall grounds, both of which are rumored to have ghostly spirits lingering around.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Chapter Houses</h3>
    <p>Last on the tour are the chapter houses, specifically the Delta Tau Delta Fraternity House, the Alpha Omicron Pi
        Sorority House and the Kappa Delta Sorority House. </p>
    <p> In 1955, one of the Delta Tau Delta brothers was killed in a car accident. Ever since, the other brothers living
        in the house began seeing furniture moving and someone’s reflection on surfaces, according to the tour. </p>
    <p> In Alpha Omicron Pi, the sisters reported hearing music playing on its own and computers shutting down randomly.
    </p>
    <p> The Kappa Delta house has the spookiest story of all when it comes to the hauntings of the chapter houses. Kappa
        Delta was founded by Alma Preinkert, who worked at the University of Maryland until she died in 1954. It is said
        that her spirit has stayed in the house, watching over the girls and making sure they follow the rules,
        according to the tour. </p>
    <p> Angelina Cassimates, a former resident of the Kappa Delta house, said the lights flickered when a rule of the
        house was broken or would shut off completely. </p>
    <p>“Our wall was shared with the showers in the bathroom and we heard knocking everyday against the wall- no one was
        ever in the bathroom,” said Kara Grossier, a Kappa Delta sister.</p>
