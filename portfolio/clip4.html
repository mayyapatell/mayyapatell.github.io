    <h1>KANYE WEST’S CURRENT CONTROVERSY: AN ANALYSIS OF ACTIONS </h1>
    <h2>Published By: HerCampus UMD</h2>
    <br>

    <p>Ye, previously named Kanye West, has been the center of attention during the past year, due to his recent remarks
        regarding antisemitism, supporting the “White Lives Matter” movement and being Pro-life.</p>
    <p>Ye has had many public outbursts, mainly on social media platforms such as Twitter and Instagram. Because of his
        vulgar language and disrespectful comments, Twitter and Instagram have restricted his accounts on and off
        throughout the past few months.</p>
    <p>“I feel hurt and sad that one of my favorite artists has no sympathy. It makes me feel different when I listen to
        his music now…I hate how he has such a huge following and promotes hurtful ideas,” said Amara Nadeem, a
        fourth-year student studying public policy.</p>
    <p>Ye lost numerous brand deals and partnerships because of his antisemitic remarks, a few being with: Balenciaga,
        Gap and Adidas.</p>

    <p>Adidas wrote in their public statement, “Adidas does not tolerate antisemitism and any other sort of hate speech.
        Ye’s recent comments and actions have been unacceptable, hateful and dangerous, and they violate the company’s
        values of diversity and inclusion, mutual respect and fairness.”</p>

    <p>On Alex Jones’ show on Dec. 1, Ye said, “I see good things about Hitler…I love Jewish people, but I also love
        Nazis.”</p>

    <p>“The Jewish media has made us feel like the Nazis and Hitler have never offered anything of value to the world,”
        Ye said.</p>
