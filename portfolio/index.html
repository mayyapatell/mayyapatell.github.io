    <h1>Maya Patel</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am currently a third year journalism major at the University of Maryland with a keen interest in storytelling
        and reporting. As a journalism major, I am committed to seeking out and sharing the truth through various media
        platforms, including print, broadcast, and digital journalism. </p>
    <p>Throughout my college experience thus far, I have been able to develop essential writing, reporting, and research
        skills that will help me during my future career. </p>
    <p>As someone with a strong interest in government and politics, I have become increasingly drawn to the field of
        law. I believe that pursuing a law degree will allow me to gain a deeper understanding of the legal system and
        how it impacts individuals and society as a whole. </p>
    <p>I am passionate about advocating for marginalized communities and promoting social justice, and I believe that a
        legal education will equip me with the tools and knowledge necessary to effect change in these areas. I am
        excited about the prospect of engaging with complex legal issues and honing my analytical and critical thinking
        skills in a rigorous academic environment, and I am eager to pursue a career that allows me to make a meaningful
        impact on the world.</p>
