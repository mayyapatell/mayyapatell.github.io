            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Prep: Take your eggs, butter, and cream cheese out of the refrigerator a couple of hours before you make the dish. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Grease two 9 × 13-inch baking pans.</li>
                <li>Melt together the butter and chocolate in a double boiler or microwave. Transfer to a large mixing bowl.</li>
                <li>Using a whisk, blend 2 cups of the sugar and the salt into the chocolate-butter mixture.</li>
                <li>Slowly add 4 of the eggs to the mixture, 1 at a time.</li>
                <li>In 3 separate batches, add in the flour.</li>
                <li>Add the vanilla.</li>
                <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a mixing bowl (if using a hand mixer), beat together the cream cheese and remaining 1 cup sugar until smooth (about 2 minutes), and then add the remaining 2 eggs, 1 at a time. (For this step, it is best to use a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, but you can use a regular mixing bowl and a hand mixer if necessary.)</li>
                <li>Measure out 1½ cups of the chocolate mixture and set aside to use as a topping.</li>
                <li>Pour the remaining chocolate mixture into the greased 9 × 13-inch pans.</li>
                <li>Spread the cream cheese mixture on top of the chocolate mixture.</li>
                <li>Fill the piping bag fitted with the #804 tip with the reserved chocolate mixture. Pipe lines along the width of the brownies, about 1 inch apart.</li>
                <li>Run the paring knife through the length of the brownies (in the opposite direction of the piped lines you created), creating a pretty streaking effect. You can also use the knife to make “swirls” of whatever design you would like.</li>
                <li>Bake at 300 degrees F for 60 minutes. Cool completely in the pans. After they cool completely at room temperature, refrigerate them in the pans for at least 4 to 5 hours before slicing.</li>
            </ol>
